# Netifi Proteus HTTP Gateway
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/netifi-proteus/proteus-httpgateway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/netifi-proteus/proteus-httpgateway)

An API Gateway that allows bridging HTTP with [Netifi Proteus](https://www.netifi.com/proteus.html).

## How does the Proteus HTTP Gateway work?
The diagram below shows the high-level architecture of how messages are received and routed by the Proteus HTTP Gateway.
 
![diagram](diagram.png)

#### 1. Send HTTP Request
Client makes an HTTP POST request to a URL in one of the following format:

If automatic load-balancing across a group of services is desired:

    https://{gateway host}/{group}/{service}/{method}

If a specific service instance is desired:

    https://{gateway host}/{group}/{destination}/{service}/{method}
    
The request body must be in JSON format and the field names much match those of the service IDL.

#### 2. Convert HTTP Request to Proteus
The incoming HTTP request is mapped to a Proteus Service IDL based on the URL and request body. The JSON request body fields
must match the fields on the IDL exactly. 

If no matching IDL can be found an error is returned.

#### 3. Send Request via Proteus Channel
The request is then sent to the Proteus Broker cluster which transparently handles service discovery and load balancing to the backend services.

If a destination was specified in the URL then the request will be sent to that specific instance. If only a group was specified, Proteus will
load balance the request to the healthiest, most performant instance, in the group using our Predictive Load Balancing algorithm.

#### 4. Invoke Service Method
The request arrives and invokes the Proteus service method.

#### 5. Send Response via Proteus Proteus Channel
The Proteus service response is sent to the Proteus Broker cluster via the same bidirectional channel used by the request.

#### 6. Send HTTP Response
The Proteus service response is converted into an HTTP response with a JSON message body and sent back to the requesting client to
complete the interaction.

## Building Proteus HTTP Gateway
You can build Proteus HTTP Gateway as an executable jar using the following command:

    $ ./gradlew clean build
    
## Updating Dependencies
Proteus HTTP Gateway build uses [Dependencies Lock strategy](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html)
Which keeps all dependencies versions snapshot in one file. Such a strategy allows avoiding caveats with libs versions and prevent accidental introduction of new dependencies in the project.

In order to update the dependencies versions, it is required to run the project build with 
additional command as in the following sample

    $ ./gradlew clean build --write-locks
    
    
## Examples
Please see the included [demo project](demo) for an example on how to configure and use Proteus HTTP Gateway.
